**STRUCTURE: **At 21 inches, Sam has bone and strength. He harkens back to the days of Harbourlights Scotia Boy -- a strong big boy, capable of picking up any size of bird. He has much to offer in a breeding, especially as we try to get some substance back into our breed.

Sam lives with his family in Black Creek, British Columbia. We have entered into a co-ownership agreement in hopes of using Sam as a Stud dog in the future. His lead man is a hunter and they have been busy training since summer and Sam is showing great apititude in the field. His first successful retrieve was at the young age of 6 months, getting a duck that otherwise would have been lost, making his owner VERY happy. Two days and a serious grooming later, Sam achieved his first three points towards his Canadian Championship at the biggest show in Canada. He took Best of Winners one day and Best Puppy in breed 2 days while his grandfather, Anando Off Center Toller Tyson took Best of Breed those same two days....must be something in the genes! At 8 months he caught onto the hunting and retrieving idea even better and retrieved 4 ducks, including an injured diving bird, as well as a Christmas goose!
