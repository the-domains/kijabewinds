# **CH KijabeWinds One Step at a Time CGN -- AERO**

**Date of Birth: **June 19, 2014

**Sire:** Watermarks's Red Ryder

**Dam: **Ella O'Kijabewinds

**Owner:** Sharon Janzen

### **Health Clearances:**

**OFA -- DM: **Normal **DE: **Normal/Clear **CPS**: Normal/Clear **CP1: **Clear/Normal**JADD: **Probable Normal **BUFF: **Clear/Normal

**Aero** has accomplished her Championship in the show ring and is enjoying just being able to play in yard and help keep the frog and deer population down. Agility training started in the fall of 2015\. None of this pocket toller syndrome for her, with solid medium bone, she is sturdy and agile. Presently she is at 19 inches at the withers, the top of the charts for female tollers. We are expecting great things from her when it comes time to breed her. We will be finishing off the remainder of her health clearances after June 2016 when she turns two.
