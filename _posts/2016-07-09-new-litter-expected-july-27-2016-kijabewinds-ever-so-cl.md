**NEW LITTER EXPECTED -- JULY 27, 2016 -- KIJABEWINDS EVER SO CLEVER X REDFOXWATERFOX SPRING2 THE MAX (Maia and Jester)**

April wasn't the month she was born, that was March, it wasn't the month she came to us, that was May, rather it was the name we chose for our first Toller. Thus KijabeWinds Kennel was established in 2000 with **Westerlea's Alderlane April (2000-2014)**

Believing first that she was our pet, our family welcomed April as a companion but we looked forward to her passing the required health clearances to become our foundation bitch. Eventually April whelped four litters the last one producing Canadian Champion **KijabeWinds Take them by Storm**. Storm has produced 4 litters and we now carry on the KijabeWinds legacy with her daughter **CH Kijabewinds Ever so Clever RE CGN **who lives in Campbell River with her owners.

We co-own her son also living in Black Creek, **CH KijabeWinds Take'Em Sam WCI CGN** (3/24/2010) and her grand-daughter, **CH Kijabewinds One Step at a Time CGN "**Aero**" **(06/18/2014) who lives with us. In July 2015 Storm had her last litter and we have two pups we are co-owning **KijabeWinds Dealer's Choice **and **KijabeWinds Playing the River. **We are very excited that the KijabeWinds family has grown and we have many happy pet homes. We believe in keeping our kennel small and by co-owning some of our offspring we can continue to produce healthy happy puppies for many more years.

Located in [Black Creek][0]****on Vancouver Island, B.C., our small scale kennel is focused on producing this healthy sporting breed for people wanting to adopt a diverse companion. As a family pet they can keep their owners active being involved in agility, field or as a gun dog for the hunter. Dam and Sire are both required to pass a full regiment of health clearances as per the ethics of the [Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever(NSDTR) Club of Canada][1]
