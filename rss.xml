            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>About us</h1><p>Dogs have been a part of our lives since we were kids. As hunting became a passion for Glenn he subscribed to the suitable magazines for the field, and from one of these publications read about an interesting little Red Dog from Nova Scotia. The article made an impact on Glenn’s memory, but it was nearly 15 years later that we thought we were ready for not only a dog, but also a new venture. Glenn could hunt and Sharon could look into breeding. It wasn’t until a year after we got April that we realized that Glenn had somewhat lost his energy for hunting due to what we eventually learned was a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis. April never did get used officially for hunting, but she did manage to snag her own grouse once or twice on our 100 acre property in Black Creek! Sharon still proceeded with the breeding program and was mentored by Alison Strang of Westerlea Kennel through the health clearances and breeding process. All of April’s pups were sold as pets and we only kept her last puppy Storm, for breeding purposes.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0ef59699-7acd-4251-8755-d45356d655e6.jpg"></article>]]></description>
